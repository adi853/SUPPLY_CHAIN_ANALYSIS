# SUPPLY_CHAIN_ANALYSIS
End to end Data Analysis project using MySQL Workbench And PowerBI
# 📊 E-commerce Supply Chain & Profitability Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of an E-commerce supply chain dataset using **Power BI** and **SQL**. The goal was to transform raw data into a functional business dashboard that identifies operational bottlenecks and profit-making opportunities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI Desktop
* **Data Processing:** Power Query
* **Database Analysis:** SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
* **Storage:** GitHub (LFS-ready/Zip compressed)

## 🚀 Key Business Insights
After analyzing the dataset, the following critical insights were identified:
- **Operational Risk:** A high **54.83% Late Delivery Rate** was detected, indicating a need for logistics optimization.
- **Top Markets:** **EE.UU (USA)** and **Puerto Rico** are the leading contributors to total profit.
- **Profitability Gap:** Using Scatter Plot analysis, it was observed that several high-sales categories have very low-profit margins, suggesting a need for pricing strategy adjustments.

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `E_commerce_Dashboard.pbix` - Interactive Power BI report with 2-page navigation.
* `Analysis_Queries.sql` - Custom SQL scripts for data aggregation and delivery performance tracking.
* `e_commerce_data.zip` - Compressed raw data (62MB CSV) for project reproducibility.

## 📈 Dashboard Preview
The dashboard consists of two main sections:
1. **Executive Summary:** High-level KPIs including Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity.
2. **Geography & Deep Dive:** Market-wise distribution and category-level profitability analysis.

*(Note: Upload your dashboard screenshots to a folder named 'images' and link them here if needed)*
